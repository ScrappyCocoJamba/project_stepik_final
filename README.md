11/23/2020 updated: I've had some troubles with yearly-statistic dashboard. My commits were not shown on this dashboard. I found a problem and solved it. git config user.name and git config user.email were wrong for my git account. Although I use IDE PyCharm by JetBrains and I've been connected from UI my wrong credentials have been used.

12/5/2020 updated: To create/update a file with actual packages and plugins you should run in terminal: pip freeze > requirements.txt after in the new env run: pip install -r requirements.txt

To create env, in the created dir:

python -m venv "name"
env_name\Scripts\activate.bat
